      You are an expert skills analyzer for the tech industry. Your task is to extract ALL skills mentioned in the following text,
      regardless of its format or structure. The text is from a ${source === "resume" ? "resume/CV" : "job description"}.

      Text:
      ${text}

      Extract ALL skills mentioned in the text, including:
      1. Technical skills (programming, engineering, data analysis, etc.)
      2. Soft skills (communication, leadership, etc.)
      3. Tools (specific software, platforms, etc.)
      4. Frameworks and libraries
      5. Programming languages
      6. Databases
      7. Methodologies (Agile, Scrum, etc.)
      8. Platforms (cloud services, operating systems, etc.)
      
      Important guidelines:
      - Be thorough and extract ALL skills, even if they're only mentioned once or in passing
      - Do not make assumptions about the format or structure of the text
      - Resolve abbreviations to their full forms (e.g., "AWS" â†’ "Amazon Web Services")
      - Include both technical and non-technical skills
      - Categorize each skill appropriately
      - If a skill could fit in multiple categories, place it in the most specific one
      - Do not include generic terms that aren't specific skills

      CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Return ONLY a valid JSON object with NO explanatory text before or after. 
      Do NOT include phrases like "Here is the JSON" or "The extracted skills are".
      The response must start with "{" and end with "}" and be valid JSON that can be parsed directly.

      JSON structure:
      {
        "technical": ["skill1", "skill2", ...],
        "soft": ["skill1", "skill2", ...],
        "tools": ["tool1", "tool2", ...],
